\f0\fs24 \cf0 The heatmap that I created combined the heatmaps for narcotics and vacant/abandoned buildings. The reason behind this was that such buildings would provide an opportunity for the use of drugs as no one would be visiting them so there should be, for that reason, a correlation between the two. From the combined heatmap for predictive policing it would appear that wards 17, 24, and 28 would require a greater amount of policing based on the overlap of narcotics and vacant buildings, meaning that there is a relationship between the number of vacant buildings and the use of narcotics.}
